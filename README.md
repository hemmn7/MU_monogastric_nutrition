## Background

This database was developed to support research in microbial carbohydrate metabolism by mapping carbohydrate-active enzymes to their respective substrates, based on EC numbers. Unlike broader databases, this dataset is specifically curated for microbial enzymes and categorizes them by carbohydrate class, polysaccharide type, and known substrates.

The database was constructed using curated information from:
- [MetaCyc](https://metacyc.org/)
- [BRENDA](https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/)
## File Structure

The main file is `carbohydrate_enzyme_reference.xlsx`, which contains the following sheets:

- **Parent**: Broad classification of enzymes by nutrient class
- **Parent2**: Adds polysaccharide specificity (e.g., cellulose, starch)
- **Parent3**: Includes sub-polysaccharide context (e.g., amorphous cellulose)
- **Parent4**: Most specific classification, with known substrates and additional notes

## Data Sources 

Data was manually curated from:
- MetaCyc (accessed March 24, 2025; Pathway Tools version 29.0)
- BRENDA (accessed March 24, 2025; Release 2024.1)

Enzymes were filtered to include:
- Microbial origin
- Clear EC number classification
- Known activity on specific carbohydrates

Substrate categories include dietary fiber (soluble/insoluble), starch, Î²-glucans, mannans, etc. Entries with unclear or non-specific activity were excluded.

## How to Use

This database is intended for use in:
- Annotating metagenomes or MAGs
- Building models of microbial carbohydrate metabolism
- Linking EC numbers to dietary carbohydrate degradation potential

Use Excel, Python (e.g., `pandas.read_excel()`), or R (`readxl::read_excel()`) to parse the data.
